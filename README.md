**# 🍓 Fruit Checker Game — Python `set` Practice

A fun and simple Python game where you check which fruits you actually ate, which are still in the fridge, and which ones you just imagined 🍎🍌🥝

Perfect for beginners learning how to use **sets** in Python!

---

## 🎯 What you will practice:
- Creating and using `set` data structures
- Performing set operations: intersection, difference
- Taking user input and processing it
- String manipulation (`split`, `strip`)

---

## 🕹️ How to Play:

1. You will be told what fruits are in your fridge.
2. Type the fruits you think you ate (e.g. `apple, kiwi`).
3. The program will show:
   - ✅ Fruits you actually ate (and were in the fridge)
   - 🧊 What’s still in the fridge
   - 🚫 Fruits that were **not** in the fridge (imagined!)

---

## 💻 Example Output:
🍽️ You really ate (from the fridge): {'banana', 'apple'}
🧊 Still in the fridge: {'pear', 'kiwi'}
🌀 Not in the fridge (imagined): {'peach'}
